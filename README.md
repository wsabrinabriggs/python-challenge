Module 3 Challenge

Hello there, and thanks for taking the time to read my code!

For pyPoll, I used the following for support with converting decimals to percent
from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-convert-fraction-to-percent-in-python/ 
 input an negative integer with denominator =1 
 integer_num = -7 
 print ("Converting number to percentage rounding to 5 place of decimal")
 print ("{:.5%}".format(integer_num))
